# City![](./public/compass.svg)Compass

## Description

CityCompass is a small game designed to test our knowledge in geography. So far, only one choice is given: to find out the French department in which the city is in. Perhaps, other variants will see the light of day, who knows.

Good luck! (The easy level is already quite challenging!)
